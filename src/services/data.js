An added touch was the “hot and cold water filter” saving time and extra costs for bottled water. Tal is also a wonderful host with impecable detail and very throughout. Just follow his instructions and directions and the (Hidden by Airbnb) “pin” (directions) and you will find it easily. I highly recommend staying here.",
